 Assume that you've been asked to produce an application that calculates the cost of lawn mowing for a week and for the entire 32 week lawn mowing season.
 The weekly fee for mowing a lot under 4000 sq ft is 25 dollars.
 The weekly fee for 4000 to 6000 sq ft is 35 dollars.
 The weekly fee for more than 6000 sq ft is 50 dollars.
 The application should prompt the user to enter the length and width of the lot.
 After calculating the square footage the application should display the weekly fee as well as the fee for the entire mowing season. 
 For example, when the user enters 150 ft and 40 ft for the length and the width of the lot, the lot is 150 * 40 or 6000 sq ft.
 The fee for 6000 sq ft is $35.
 The charge for the 32 week season would be 35 * 32 or $1120.
 In a text editor create an IPO chart that describes WHAT needs to be done to solve the problem AND an algorithm in pseudocode that describes EXACTLY HOW you would solve the problem.
